# MMCDS: A Multi-Stage and Multi-Model Hybrid Screening Solution for Male Contraception
## Overview
CLS stage (DTI Classification): Predicting the potential binding ability between small molecules and proteins, used to quickly screen for potential hits from large-scale candidate sets.

REG stage (DTA Regression): Further affinity regression prediction is performed on the molecules selected in the CLS stage for sorting candidate molecules.

## How to Run
